## ðŸ”§ How to Run the Project Locally

1. **Clone the Repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sneha-Nahak/Sneha_Nahak_fs40_405845.git

You can double-click the file or use Live Server (VSCode extension).

ðŸ’¡ No build or server is required â€” it's a pure frontend project.

ðŸ§  How I Implemented the YouTube API
Used YouTube Data API v3 to fetch videos based on user search queries.

Used fetch() with the following endpoint:

bash
Copy
Edit
https://www.googleapis.com/youtube/v3/search?key=YOUR_API_KEY&part=snippet&type=video&q=SEARCH_QUERY
Parsed the API response to dynamically:

Show video thumbnails, titles, and channel names

Load a selected video in a player view

API key was securely stored in a .env (not committed to GitHub), but for local testing you may place it directly in script.js.

ðŸ“¦ Files Included
index.html â€“ Main structure of the site

style.css â€“ Responsive and modern layout styling

script.js â€“ Logic for handling search, video load, and API calls

assets/ â€“ Icons, logos, or other static files
